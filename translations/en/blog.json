    "description": "Hello World.<br /><br />My name is Max and I'm a student from Denmark, trying to sort out my life. I have a deep interest in computing, which has led me to discover many things in the field. Some of these things are posted here, if they're interesting enough. Although, some things here are, most likely, not interesting to most, anyway.<br /><br />I spend most of my time tinkering with different subjects in IT, trying to learn as I go. This mostly involves programming, system administration and DevOps.<br /><br />I currently selfhost many of the services I use, such as GitLab, Plex and e-mail. So, many of my interests lie in privacy, security and personalization. That's also why I have my own blog, instead of using centralized services.<br /><br />Do I know what I'm doing? Most likely not. I'm not a professional software developer or sys-admin. I will soon, but not yet. I'm just trying to learn things, that I can put into practice some day."
