* 📍 Originating and currently living in Denmark.
* ☕ Still trying to learn to drink coffee.
* 👨🏽‍💻 I'm currently working on <a href="https://github.com/maxnatamo/Chart">Chart</a> and a secret private project.
* 🔨 I'm learning about CI/CD (via GitLab CI) and Kubernetes (via ArgoCD).

I'm a newly-educated backend developer from Skive, Denmark.

I am a software developer, and the creator of a GraphQL execution engine, <a href="https://github.com/maxnatamo/Chart">Chart</a>; and a simple link-shortener, called <a href="https://github.com/maxnatamo/surt">Surt</a>. Most of my projects are open source and can be found here on GitHub and my GitLab instance.

I have most of my experience from backend development, but I also work in some frontend development from time to time. I also do DevOps stuff daily on my home-server.
